# hpFX Test Configuration File

# IMPORTANT:
#  - Arguments provided on the command line always take precedence over what's defined in this input file.
#  - Only the parameters in this file are supported. If you specify others, they'll be ignored, even if
#    they may be valid for terminal.exe

# Puts test results under different folders corresponding to different categories which should be analysed together.
# For example C1_Only, C1+C2, BL+C1+C2, C1+C2+Vol... You get the point. No special characters, please.
# OPTIONAL (all tests will be placed under the same directory if left blank)
TestCategory: SEE_TEST_MAKER_INPUT

# 'testUniqueName' is a unique name you can give to this test. Folders for configurations and results are named after it.
# Make sure you use a unique name to prevent overwriting previously created results, especially if you are running
# variations of the same test (different spread, time frame etc).
# hpFX will append the date range automatically to it minimize mistakes: E.g.
# Given testUniqueName: 'C1_SSL_C2_RVI_V_ADX'  --> created folder name: 'C1_SSL_C2_RVI_V_ADX-20180101-20190101'
# If this parameter is not defined, then it'll be generated after the TestExpertParameters. E.g.:
# Given TestExpertParameters: 'inputs\C1_SSL_C2_RVI_V_ADX.set' --> created folder name: 'C1_SSL_C2_RVI_V_ADX-20180101-20190101'
# OPTIONAL (leave blank if you want to be generated after TestExpertParameters)
