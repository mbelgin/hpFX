# IMPORTANT:
#  - Command-line arguments take precedence over this input file.
#  - Only the parameters listed here are supported. Any additional keys, even if valid for terminal.exe, will be ignored.

# The main category name for this collection of tests. You can run other simulations and organize them under this category.
# All results in this category will be stored in a folder named after the category, so avoid special characters.
# You can name it anything. For example: My_Test_Runs, Entry_Only, Entry_Conf, BL_Entry_Conf, Entry_Conf_Vol, etc.
#
# Note: Thereâ€™s no need to organize by time range, since hpFX automatically separates results into subfolders per time range.
#
# OPTIONAL: if left blank, all tests will be placed in the same root results directory
TestCategory: My_Test_Runs
  
# 'testUniqueName' is a unique name you can give to this test. Folders for configurations and results are named after it.  
# Make sure you use a unique name to prevent overwriting previously created results, especially if you are running  
# variations of the same test.  
# IMPORTANT:
#     - Give it a unique name if you are running a single simulation using this configuration
#     - Leave it BLANK if you are planning to use this configuration as an input template for bin/test_case_maker.py
