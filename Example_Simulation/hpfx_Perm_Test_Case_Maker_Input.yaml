TestCategory: HPFX_PERMUTATIONS

# A sample expert configuration template (*.set) used to define hpFX simulation settings.
# Create this by loading hpFX_Engine.mq4 in MT4's Strategy Tester, adjusting the settings, and saving as a .set file.
# All test cases will inherit settings from this file, except for indicator-specific parameters.
# Common parameters (e.g., risk %, TP MULTIPLIER) will remain consistent across all tests—ensure they match your intended setup.
# The file itself remains unchanged during execution and can be reused across runs.
# Specify either an absolute path or a path relative to the current working directory (usually the `bin` folder).

ExpertTemplate: ..\Example_Simulation\my_test_EA_properties.set

# An hpFX configuration template (*.yaml) used to construct test input files.
# Only the 'TestUniqueName:' and 'TestExpertParameters:' sections will be modified.
# All other fields (e.g., TestFromDate:, TestToDate:, TestSymbolsList:) must already match your intended test setup.
# This file remains unchanged during execution and can be reused across runs.
# Specify either an absolute path or a path relative to the execution directory.

hpFXTemplate: ..\Example_Simulation\hpfx_EXAMPLE_SINGLE_BATCH.yaml

# Path to the folder where auto-generated expert configuration files (*.set) and hpFX configuration files (*.yaml) will be saved.
# These files are created for each individual simulation run, making re-runs possible and serving as detailed, self-describing records of the run conditions.
# This path must be relative to the shared data folder (mt4_results_folder in global_config.yaml).
# Do NOT provide an absolute path here.

# Test modes that define how indicators are used and in what order.

# TestMode: 1  
# Entry → Conf, BL, Vol → Exit  
# Enter when the Entry indicator signals a Buy/Sell, and all of Confirmation, Baseline, and Volatility indicators agree. 
# Exit when the Exit indicator signals.

# TestMode: 2  
# BL → Entry, Conf, Vol → Exit  
# Enter when the Baseline indicator signals a Buy/Sell, and Entry, Confirmation, and Volatility indicators agree. 
# Exit when the Exit indicator signals.

# TestMode: 3  
# Entry | BL → Conf, Vol → Exit  
# Enter when either Entry OR Baseline triggers a signal, and both Confirmation and Volatility indicators agree. 
# Exit when the Exit indicator signals.
# In all modes, at least one indicator that defines the Entry condition is required.
# Missing optional indicators are silently ignored.
# For example, TestMode=2 will fail if BL is missing, since it's the only entry trigger in that mode.
# However, it's valid to omit Entry in this mode, as Confirmation and Volatility can still be used to confirm the trade.
# If Exit is missing, trades will close when the Take Profit (TP) defined in the .set file is reached.
# TestMode: 1

# List of indicators to be used in the simulations.
#
# Indicators must be organized under the following required categories:
# BL, ENTRY, CONF, VOL, EXIT
#
# All category headers must be present in the configuration file. If no indicators are used in a category,
# its section can be left empty, but it must still exist—hpFX will raise an error otherwise.
#
# You may reuse the same indicator in multiple roles (e.g., an ENTRY indicator can also serve as an EXIT indicator
# with reversed logic), as long as it is defined under the appropriate categories with valid definitions.
#
# Format: <given name> | <indicator type> | <indicator definition>
#
# 'given name' is a human-readable label for the indicator, such as 'ENTRY_ADX'.
# This name will appear in filenames for generated expert configuration files (*.set),
# e.g. 'BL_KIJUN-SEN+ENTRY_ADX.set'.
#
# 'indicator type' must be one of the following (with the required definition format shown in comments):
#   BASELINECROSS   // <parameters>;<indicator_file>;<buffer>
#   TWOLINESCROSS   // <parameters>;<indicator_file>;<buffer1>,<buffer2>
#   ONELEVELCROSS   // <parameters>;<indicator_file>;<buffer>;<level>
#   TWOLEVELCROSS   // <parameters>;<indicator_file>;<(+/-)buffer>;<high_level>,<low_level>
#   SLOPE           // <parameters>;<indicator_file>;<buffer>
#   HISTOGRAM       // <parameters>;<indicator_file>;<buffer1>,<buffer2>
#   LINEMACROSS     // <parameters>;<indicator_file>;<buffer1>;<MA_period>,<MA_type>
#   ARROWS          // <parameters>;<indicator_file>;<long_buffer>,<short_buffer>
#
# The 'indicator definition' must follow the format required for its type, as described above.

# In this example, the following BL, ENTRY, CONF, VOL and EXIT sections can be left blank because only
# ENTRY_PERMS are considered when Entry_Permutations is set to 'True'. If you include any indicator entries
# they will be ignored.
BL:

ENTRY:

CONF:

VOL:

EXIT:


# Enable testing of all ENTRY + CONF permutations? (True/False)
#
# If 'Entry_Permutations' is set to True, all permutations of the indicators listed in "ENTRY_PERMS" (see below)
# will be tested against each other. Each indicator will act as ENTRY in one test and as CONF in another.
#
# This is especially useful when you've identified the top-N ENTRY indicators and want to find the best-performing pairs.
# Be mindful that the number of test cases grows quadratically with N, as P(N, 2) = N × (N - 1), so don't pick a very large N.
#
# Example:
# ENTRY_PERMS:
# ENTRY1 | ... | ...
# ENTRY2 | ... | ...
# ENTRY3 | ... | ...
#
# P(3, 2) yields:
# {ENTRY1, ENTRY1}, {ENTRY1, ENTRY2}, {ENTRY1, ENTRY3},
# {ENTRY2, ENTRY1}, {ENTRY2, ENTRY2}, {ENTRY2, ENTRY3},
# {ENTRY3, ENTRY1}, {ENTRY3, ENTRY2}, {ENTRY3, ENTRY3}
#
# If 'Entry_Permutations' is True, the 'ENTRY' and 'CONF' sections elsewhere in the configuration must be left blank.

Entry_Permutations: True

# A list of indicators to permute as ENTRY and CONF when 'Entry_Permutations' is enabled.
# Leave blank if 'Entry_Permutations' is set to False.
